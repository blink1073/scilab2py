Scilab2Py is a means to seamlessly call Scilab functions and scripts from Python.
It manages the Scilab session for you, sharing data behind the scenes using
MAT files.  Usage is as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> sci = scilab2py.Scilab2Py()
    >>> x = sci.zeros(3,3)
    >>> print x, x.dtype
    [[ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]
     [ 0.  0.  0.]] float64
    ...


Features
--------

- Supports most Scilab datatypes and most Python datatypes and Numpy dtypes.
- Provides ScilabMagic_ for IPython, including inline plotting in notebooks.
- Supports cell arrays and structs with arbitrary nesting.
- Supports sparse matrices.
- Builds methods on the fly linked to Scilab commands (e.g. `zeros` above).
- Nargout is automatically inferred by the number of return variables.
- Thread-safety: each Scilab2Py object uses an independent Scilab session.
- Can be used as a context manager.
- Supports Unicode characters.
- Supports logging of session commands.
- Optional timeout command parameter to prevent runaway Scilab sessions.
